README for the BLISS-M Compiler
===============================

This is the source package for the BLISS-M compiler, a portable
cross-compiler for the BLISS programming language.
Visit the [project website](http://madisongh.github.io/blissc)
for more information about BLISS-M.

Current Status
--------------

Work in progress.   The front-end is mostly complete, with a fully
functioning parser and macro facility.  Back-end support is currently
limited to LLVM and x86 CPUs (32- or 64-bit), with a limited amount
of machine-specific support.

Prerequisites
-------------

Known to build on Mac OS X 10.8 and 10.9 (using Xcode 4.6 and later)
and Ubuntu 16.04 and later (64-bit).

The code generator uses LLVM 3.9, 4.0 or 5.0, which you can download
directly from llvm.org.  On Mac OS, you can use the MacPorts llvm
packages, although debugging is easier if you build against a copy of
LLVM you have built yourself from source. On Ubuntu systems, you can
install one of the llvm-dev packages using apt.

The build system uses Autoconf and Automake.  On Mac OS X, you'll
need to install these packages (e.g., through MacPorts).

Building the compiler
---------------------

1. Clone [the repository](https://github.com/madisongh/blissc.git).

2. cd to the top-level source directory and run `autoreconf -i`
   to set up the autotools build.

3. If you want to build outside the source tree, cd to your
   build directory.

4. Run the `configure` script that was generated in step 2.  If
   `llvm-config` is not in your PATH, use the `--with-llvm-config`
   option on `configure` to specify its location.

5. Run `make` to build the compiler.

6. Run `make check` to test the built compiler.


Running the compiler
--------------------

The build will produce a program called **blissc** in your build
directory.  Run `./blissc --help` for a description of the arguments
and options.
